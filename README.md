### Triiio - Plexus Assignment - Embedded C++

This project simulated a Temperature Sensor, being polled in a thread at 5Hz and a Motor Controller/Speed sensor
polling the motor speed at a 2Hz speed on another thred.

The main loop gathers the data from the two sensors and prints them on a carriage-returned line.
